# Disposal

“What the fuck was that?” Gracie’s voice was uncharacteristically shrill.  “Michael, you need to explain to me what the fuck just happened.”
“Not now.” He urged. “We need to get out of here. As it is, I don’t even know how you…” His hands were shaking as he jammed the key into the ignition, missing several times before finally finding his mark.
“When were you going to tell me about the whole bear thing?” She asked.
“It’s kinda hard to bring up on a first date.” He pointed out drily.  They backed out and raced down the parking garage ramp, oddly deserted despite the whole fire-imp-bear thing.  
“I think you should probably include it as a disclaimer before you ask someone out.” Gracie grumbled, but she could see his point.
“I’m not… Listen.  I promise that you will get answers.  Tonight.  But we need to get this thing somewhere before it falls into the wrong hands.”
Ah, yes. The lifeless imp that he had tossed unceremoniously into the bed of the truck. Gracie was momentarily speechless.  Promised answers — and soon — she had nothing more to complain about.  A courteous greeting to the parking attendant and a left turn later, Gracie finally came up with another question.  
“Is that thing alive?”
“No. Well. It wasn’t alive to begin with, but it’s just a body. Lifeless matter.”
“And why was it…?
“Ah, ah.” He stopped her.  “Questions after we get there.”
“Where are we going, exactly?”
“My uncle’s house.”
“Was your uncle also a shapeshifting midget murderer?”
Michael burst out laughing.  “I’m not sure.  We never discussed how many… midgets… he dispatched in his days.”

The house loomed ominously over the drive as the truck pulled in with its cargo, a formerly flaming, now dead (and still naked) midget. 
“So, we’re here…” Gracie offered.  They had been talking, albeit uneasily, for most of the ride, but had lulled into a silence.
“Not yet.”  She felt like an intruder into a private world.  His response was gruff.  Not unkind, but short nonetheless.
He clicked the shifter up into “Park” and turned the key. The truck’s rumble died.  He opened his door, then looked up, as if he suddenly remembered that she was there.
“Stay here, please.  I’ll be back in a moment and we can go inside.”
Gracie nodded, pulling her sweater closer around her shoulders, watching as he jumped out of the vehicle in a fluid, inhuman motion. Was that the bear in him? No, it couldn’t be. She had seen plenty of bear footage on television, and never did “graceful” cross her thoughts as a possible adjective.
She turned, straining to see as the tailgate slammed down, vibrating the truck. It was dark and no porch or garage lights had come on to greet them. Only the headlights had shown her there was a house, and now, those too were gone. Only the half-moon lit the night sky, and that barely, shrouded by trees. 
The truck shook again, and Gracie knew that he had removed the body and closed the tailgate.  She heard crunching, muffled by the closed truck cab, growing more distant. He was taking it somewhere.
Briefly, insanity clouded her thoughts and she wondered if she was next. After all, he had seemed confused by the fact that she was present while the entire encounter occurred.  Was he disposing of her to prevent possible problems? Was this how all of his other first dates had ended?
She pushed the thoughts away.  She knew that she was being silly.  He would’ve just left her there and disappeared, right? That’s what super heroes do.  But was he a super hero? A mutant?  Some weird member of a live-action flash mob designed to scare the living shit out of normal people?
Her feet were growing cold. Sitting in the cold metal cabin and listening to the wind pick up around the truck, her mind turned to how long it would take before he would retrieve her.  Moments later, a knock on her window gave the answer she needed.  Michael’s face loomed in the frame and he pointed to the lock.  She reached over and pulled it up. He opened the door with a smile.
“Alright, I don’t normally take girls home on the first date, but…”
“I don’t think this qualifies as a first date. Not anymore.  Not after the…”
“Yes, yes. I know. Answers await you inside.” He motioned towards the darkened house. “After you.”
“No thanks. I can’t see anything.  It’s your turn to lead.” Gracie hopped out of the truck, avoiding his opened arms with an awkward yet determined jump.  She would not willingly fall into his arms until he told her the truth.  He shrugged and shut the door behind her.  
The gravel path up to the house was well trodden, though still covered with long dead leaves from autumn’s end.  Michael took the porch steps quickly, keys jangling as he moved to the front door and unlocked it.  Gracie followed more carefully, both unfamiliar with the territory and slightly creeped out.  
He pushed the door open and his arm disappeared inside. The porch light popped on, blinding Gracie. When her vision cleared, Michael was looking apologetically at her.
“Sorry. Should have warned you about the light.  Here, come on in. Do you like coffee?”
“No, thank you.” She responded and followed him into the house. Michael waited for her to shut the door, then walked towards a darkened room and flipped on the lights. Kitchen. 
“Well, I could use some, so why don’t you make yourself comfortable.” He waved his arm at the furniture dotting the living room, an assortment of arm chairs and a couch.  She nodded and went to choose her seat.  He returned and settled onto the couch next to the chair she had chosen.  He sat comfortably, his legs bent and tucked under him.
“So…” Her voice trailed off, waiting for him to begin.
“So.” He agreed, taking a moment to assess the unease in her voice and the rigidity that held her back straight and her hands locked neatly in her lap.  “You’re nervous. Freaked out, even. I get it.” He took a deep breath. “Gracie… I’m a Guardian.  We’re a special group of people that… inherit powers to detect and destroy intruders into this physical world.”  He paused, seeing if she wanted to interject, but she just nodded thoughtfully, allowing him to continue.  “There are Guardians scattered across the world. Some battle demons, others, ghosts. Some simply monitor those creatures that have agreed to live peacefully among us.”
“Like unicorns?”
“No. Unicorns aren’t real.”
“But flaming midgets are?”  Gracie raised an eyebrow.
“Well, that was a demon. So technically, no. Flaming midgets aren’t real unless they’re people with dwarfism that, for some unfortunate reason, are on fire.” Michael readjusted himself slightly before continuing.
“I — well, my uncle, until recently, was the Brookfield guardian.”
“And what are you?” 
“I was a traveler.  Not every town and city can have a guardian.  Each country is broken into regions and although the major landmarks have watchers, most of the land is covered by regional mobile units.”  He smiled gently, as if to soften the blow of another reality lurking under her own.  “We’re basically like homeless CIA agents.”
“So…?” Gracie didn’t know what to ask first, but he nodded.
“I know. It’s confusing.  Like I said, my uncle was the Brookfield guardian.  He… went missing last month.  No one knows where he is.  We assume that it’s demon related, but honestly, we haven’t got a freaking clue.”
“So you’re a demon battler?”
“I do both, as do most… but yes, I specialize in demons. Creatures that don’t originate in our world.”
“And what’s with the bear thing?”
“Shapeshifting is unique to each guardian.  I became a bear.  Others become wolves. Large cats. Most are predators of some sort.  It probably has to do with some affinity for the animals that we receive in our childhood, but again, no one really knows.”
Gracie mulled this for a while.  Michael stood and went to the kitchen, returning in moments with a freshly brewed cup of coffee.  
“That demon was the first I’d seen since coming. But the fact that it arose in such a public place disturbs me.  We’re… attractive, to the demons. They know that the guardians are their only barrier between them and their freedom.  Most… they usually attack when you’re in a weak state. Asleep or distracted.  They wait for missteps.  But lately there have been more random attacks. More disappearances. Not just here, but all over the place. They’re planning something.”
“So why…” Grace spoke again, but paused as if to choose her words more carefully.  “Why ask me out, if you have … stuff like this going on?”
“Dating is not forbidden among us.” Michael said. He shrugged. “Everything I said before is true.  You’re intriguing to me. I’m inexplicably drawn to you. I think you’re cute.” He reached towards her face and brushed a stray lock of hair back behind her ear, sending chills through her body.  “I think you’re beautiful. Not just physically, but as a person, Gracie. I know almost nothing about you, yet, I’ve never been as interested in a woman as I am in you.”
He took his hand away, suddenly embarrassed.  “I’m sorry.  There I go, doing it again.  You don’t need me in your life. It could be dangerous.  Here, please. Let me take you home.” He set his coffee down on the nearby table and went to rise.  
“I…” She trailed off indecisively. “No.  I can’t.  You… if… if there are these things in this world, and they’re everywhere, and they might come after me.”
“Gracie, I doubt they’d come after you.  Like I said, they’re attracted to us, not humans. The safest place for you is far away from me.”  He stood and offered her his hand.  “Here. Please.  Let me take you home.”
