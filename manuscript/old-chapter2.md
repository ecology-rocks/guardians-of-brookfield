# The Car

Snow drifted gently down from the sky, coating the rusted blue Pontiac with a fine layer of white dust.  The car rumbled awkward and resentful. Gracie turned the key determinedly in the ignition. 
“Come on, come on!” She muttered her prayers.
The clunker stalled, briefly, then roared into full life.  Gracie kissed her fingers and pressed them against the tattered beige ceiling.  The car rolled victorious from her parking spot.
“Another day, baby.” Together, Gracie and the car turned onto the cratered, broken pavement.
Two lefts and a right.   The driveway sloped upwards into a pavement desert, and beyond that, the neon green glow of Cafe Escape’s welcoming OPEN sign.  Gracie and her beast rested between the faded yellow lines of a dull gray parking spot.  
Where they had been assaulted by snow, the bricks seemed a more brilliant red, contrasting the sour apple sign. Gracie remembered suddenly that Christmas was coming soon.  
Her ride shuddered to a stop and she anxiously gathered up her purse, shoving her cell and keys inside.  She checked for her wallet, reached to the far door to depress its button, and took a deep breath.  The cafe door opened, its jingles jarring her to her senses.  Time to go.  
“Doors locked, keys in—“ Gracie stopped short and looked in horror through the freshly closed Pontiac’s window.  Inside, morning sun glinted off the metal buckle of her purse. “Shit.”
She kicked the heavy metal door, furious.  The dull thud sounded as pathetic as she felt.  She reached her fingers under the handle and pulled. Nothing.  No click, no door opening.  Just the feeling of frustration as she realized that it was going to be a long, long day.  
The door’s teasing jingle made her feel even worse when Gracie wormed her way through the tables to the front counter.
“Hey Gracie!”  James’ smile shown through his beard.  “How are you this morning?”
“Not so great.” Gracie looked down at the counter.  Her fingers pressed white against the fogged glass surface.  “I locked my keys in my car.”
“Oh, shit!” James’ outburst brought a few patrons’ eyes to his face.  He smothered a laugh.  “I’m sorry, sweetie. Do you want me to call someone?”
“Could you? I don’t know anyone to call and my Triple A expired last month…” Gracie hated asking for help.
“I’m surprised they even covered your beast to begin with.” James said.  “Hang on, let me get your order first.”
“You know I can’t pay until I get my car unlocked, right?” Gracie asked doubtfully.  “I don’t want you to get in trouble with the boss.”
“Meredith can go to hell.  You need your coffee.  I know you’re good for the eighty cents.” James moved to the grinder and started it before Gracie could reply.  
Gracie turned her back on James to scan the coffee house’s earthy interior.  The brick walls were dotted with local artist photographs, the tables a hodge podge of wood and color.  The grinder stopped and Gracie turned back to James.  
“How’s the week been for you?” She asked him and he shrugged, dumping the rich brown powder into a filter.
“Same old, same old.”  James flipped the switch and leaned on the counter near the register.  “Jack’s got another ear infection.   Damn beagles and their ears.  Oh! I know,” James brightened.  “We finally hired someone new.  Hey!”  James turned to call out towards the swinging kitchen door.  “Michael.  Come out here.”
“He’s our new cook.” James explained as Michael walked through the door.  Firm biceps peeked from beneath his black tee, face framed by  short, fuzzy hair and oversized ears.  
“Got an order?” Michael’s bright blue eyes wandered before settling on Gracie.  She felt suddenly like a horse on display.
“No, no.” James said.  “This is Gracie.  She’s a regular.”  James ducked out of the way, allowing Michael access to the front counter.
“Hi.” Gracie said shyly, extending her hand.  He took it warmly.  
“Nice to meet you, Gracie.”  His eyes were like diamonds, boring into her very soul.  She felt a tingle in the pit of her stomach.  “I’ll be happy to serve you sometime soon.”
Gracie was speechless.  Fire ran from her finger tips, up her arm, then down her spine and straight to her groin.  Oblivious to the sexual tension, James patted Michael on the back.  Gracie jumped back.  Her cheeks flamed red.
“Do you know where the phone book is yet?”  James asked, and arousal turned to fear in Gracie’s stomach in an instant.  “Gracie locked her keys in her car.  We have to call someone.”
Michael never took his eyes from Gracie’s burning red face.  She was sure that it matched the exterior bricks.  “We don’t need to call anyone.”  Michael shook his head.  “I’ve got a jimmy kit in my car.  I should be able to do it.”
The coffee maker released a sudden burst of steam and puttered the last few drops of the coffee into her cup.  
“I’m off at noon.” Michael announced abruptly.  “Can you wait fifteen minutes?” 
It was a question, but it felt more like a command.  Gracie nodded, appearing relieved.  James looked at him through raised eyebrows.
“You don’t have to wait until the end of your shift.  Consider it part of the job.”
“You sure, man?” Michael’s biceps lengthened as he pushed away from the counter.  “I don’t want to get in trouble with —” 
“Meredith will be fine.” James assured him.  “Go take off your apron and help the damsel in distress.”
“Hey!” Gracie complained.  “I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself.”  
“I’m sure you are.” James pulled her coffee from the machine and slipped a drink cover on the cardboard cup, handing it over.  “I wouldn’t complain.  This guy would charge for his services if he wasn’t on the clock.”  James pushed lightly on Michael’s shoulder.  
Gracie laughed at James.  Michael untied his apron and slung it over the swinging door.  
“Let me know if you need anything, alright?” Michael asked and James nodded.  
“I’m sure I can handle it until Sid gets here.” James assured him.
“Alright, where to?”  Michael turned his intense, fiery gaze on Gracie.  She stuttered, her mouth wide open in a sudden rush of surprise, sex, and embarrassment. 
“M- My car is out front.” She managed to get out words in the correct order.  
Michael scrunched up his face and stroked his chin, the light fuzz moving underneath his fingers like a wave.  Gracie wondered what that fuzz would feel like on her throat, then pushed the thought away.
“Hmm…” Michael seemed oblivious to Gracie’s stuttering.  “Well, my tools are out back, so why don’t you come with me, and we’ll get this done?”
“Oh. I. Uh.” Gracie started to protest, but Michael turned on his heel and strode towards the kitchen door.  She scooted under the counter and passed James’ dirty grin.  
“Have fun.” James said playfully, too quiet for the other man to hear.  Gracie’s face burned hotter than the coffee she held.  James knew that she was flustered. He was enjoying it!  
She braced the swinging bakery door with her coffee-free hand and followed Michael through the cramped aisles of the small, overworked kitchen.  The metal shone with fluorescent light, nearly blinding her.  Michael was waiting patiently at the door topped by a red exit sign.  Seeing her draw close, Michael opened the door and backed himself against it to allow her to pass, body to body, next to him.  
“Thank you.” She said in the most confident voice she could muster. She was all nerves. First her car, and now… well, now there was an attractive man offering to fix it for her and all she could think about was getting in his pants.
Flustered, she did not notice the discrepancy between the building’s floor and the pavement outside.  She reached for a step that wasn’t there and lost her balance.  Yelping, she reached for anything she could out of instinct.  In an instant, his warm, strong hand was wrapped around her upper arm, holding her up.  And her coffee?  That was on his pants. 
“Oh god, oh god.” She moaned when she regained her sense of what happened.  Her eyes were plastered on his coffee stained denim bulge.  Her nose was inhaling his scent, some rich cologne mixed with Colombian coffee.
“Normally women save that for the first date.” The phrase startled Gracie momentarily, and she stared into his bright blue eyes, embarrassment replaced by confusion. 
“You know.” He continued.  Now he was the one embarrassed. “You said ‘Oh god oh god.’  It was a joke.  You ok?”  He reached under her other arm and hauled her fully up to her feet.  
Gracie searched for words.  She looked down at his crotch again,then noticed the coffee steaming off of the cool pavement. “Yeah. I, uh…”  Not sure what else to say, she pointed helplessly at his penis.
“You, uh…” A shadow of a grin played across his face, and he began to offer suggestions. “Don’t like my jokes? Think dinosaurs exist? Are secretly a vampire?” She said nothing and he paused for effect.  “Spilled your coffee on me? Yeah. I noticed.”
“Sorry…” Gracie found that word easily enough.  “I… let me get you some napkins.”  She tried to turn towards the door and realized he was still steadying her gently, his hands resting on her ribs below her breasts.
“It’s fine.” Michael said firmly.  “Don’t worry about it. It’s just coffee. Let’s go get those tools before you trip and kill yourself, shall we?” He gently released her and she felt the rush of cool air along her ribs. She shivered.  
“Sorry.” She said again, helpless.  
“Can I trust you to walk over there?” Michael pointed towards a big black truck parked in the far corner.  “Or should I leave you where I can see you?”
“I’m fine.” She said, but realized belatedly that he was joking.  He motioned.  
“After you.  That way, I can catch you when you fall.” 
Gracie led the way, wary of his eyes boring into her back.  Was he evaluating this mess of a person that he had offered to help? Was he checking her out? Looking with sympathy? She had no idea.  She turned her head to make small talk, but he cut her off.
“You keep your eyes forward.  I can’t trust you to do two things at once.”  He admonished in her ear.  He was much closer to her than she had realized. Fire raged in her belly.  
They made it to the truck with no further incidents.  Reaching over the bed, Michael clicked open a small box and pulled out a clear plastic bag with black, bronze, and green rubber-coated items.  
“Out front?”  His voice startled her from her assessment of his firm, well crafted behind.
“Yeah.”
“Like my butt?”  He asked suddenly, his gaze daring and mischievous.  
“What? I. Uh.”  He burst into laughter before she could stutter more.  
“Relax, relax.”  He reached for her shoulder.  “I’m just messing with you.”  His touch was warm, and firm.  “It’s okay.”  
Gracie’s eyes glistened and his look of amusement turned to concern instantly.
“Are you sure you’re alright?”  She nodded, looking away.  The fire in her was anxious.  Don’t cry, Gracie.  You can’t cry.  Do NOT cry. She repeated this mantra to herself. She looked up at the sky, willing the tears back into her tear ducts.  It was silly.  There was no reason to cry.  Never mind that she had locked her keys in her car and spilled coffee on a complete stranger, then got caught checking out his butt in a fifteen minute timespan.  
And there they were.  The tears were back.  The crazy had won.  The moment a tear had left her eye, he was wrapping her in those prize-winning arms of his.  His hand threaded through her hair.  
“Hey, it’s okay.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to make you cry.  Please stop crying.  It was just a joke.”
“I know, I know.” She blurted.  “It’s not you.” She was trying her best to stop the tear flow, but that little voice in the back of her head kept pointing out that the longer she cried, the longer she could inhale his scent, feel his sexy arms enclosing her, and basically just get a cheap thrill.  “It’s just been a rough day.”
“Hey now.” He chided.  “It can’t be that bad.”
“My car… the coffee…”  She knew she was done crying, more embarrassed than ever, but she couldn’t find the strength inside to pull from his heavenly grasp.
“My butt…” He loosened his grip.  Damn it! She thought.  He knew she was done with her tears.
“Your butt…” She agreed, pushing away from his grasp but keeping her gaze peeled on the cracked pavement.  
“Never had a woman cry over my butt before.”  She cracked a smile at his joke.
“You’re not going to…” She trailed off, choosing her words carefully, but he finished the question for her.
“Tell the staff that you were staring at my butt? Nah.”
“But it is a nice butt.” She pointed out.  “I’m sure you’re proud of it.”  She literally couldn’t do anything else to embarrass herself. Why not flirt back?  Was this even flirting?
“I am.”  He acknowledged.  He bent down leisurely in front of her, taking his time while picking up his bag of tools, even wiggling his butt a little in her face.  She laughed.  “But I can keep the secret for a while.  Wouldn’t want to lose your business.”  He rose again.  “You ready to go get your keys?” 
“Yeah.”  She nodded.  
He motioned towards the side of the building.  “After you.”  
She took her steps carefully, painfully aware of him watching her.  This time, she could feel him behind her, too close for comfort.
“So how exactly did you lock your keys in your car?” He asked as they wound their war around the brick corner.
“I just left my purse in the car and shut the door before I grabbed it.”
“Aren’t purses attached at women’s hips?”  He asked, and she shrugged.
“It’s… new to me. I didn’t used to carry one.”
“Oh?”
“Yeah. Turning over a new leaf and stuff.”  Gracie’s tension seemed to be easing.  They rounded the corner and she led the way to her car.  
“Here she is.” Gracie gestured grandly at the Pontiac.
“Okay, great. Give me a minute here.” Michael reached into the bag and pulled out a long, thin metal rectangle.  
Michael unceremoniously jabbed the long metal tool into the space between the window pane and the faded blue door frame.  The tool disappeared into the depths of the door.  A few wiggles, an eyebrow furrow, and a click.  The button popped up and Gracie felt relief wash over her.  
“Thank you, thank you!”  She said.  He fished his tool from her car and reached for the door handle.
“No problem.  So, about that payment…” He trailed off, a smile playing across his face.  
“I thought Meredith was paying you.”  She said drily and he shrugged.
“Well, yes, but… you ruined my pants…” Her laughter cut him off.  
“It’s more like you ruined my coffee.”  She bent through the open door and grabbed her purse from the passenger seat.
“Oh?”
“I could’ve kept the cup upright if you hadn’t grabbed me. So I think we’re even.”  Gracie rummaged through the purse to find her keys.  She pulled them out as if wrangling a dog from a pile of steaming poop.  
“You know, once you get over being flustered, you’re kind of a smart ass.”  Michael said. His directness surprised her. 
“Sorry.” She was taken aback.  
“No, no.” He stopped her before she could descend into another puddle of embarrassment. “I like it.  It’s… cute.”
“Oh. I. Uh.”
“I’m not sure if I like the ‘smart ass’ you or the ‘kid who knocked an entire grocery shelf down’ you better.” Michael made quotation marks with his hands for his two examples.  Gracie was silent, not sure which part of her wanted to respond.  Taking her silence for permission, he continued.
“I’d like to take you out sometime.” Michael gently shut the car door and leaned against it.  His coffee stained denim was dark, black shirt wet with snowflakes.   “I think we’d have a lot of fun.”  Gracie was stunned. 
“I bet we have a lot in common.” Michael continued. “And I think you need someone to keep you upright and in one piece.”
“I don’t need a man.” Gracie grumbled, and Michael laughed, reaching out to brush a finger gently down the line of her jaw.
“See? Smart ass you is back!  I think you also need someone to keep you in line.”  He winked.  It was meant as a joke, but Gracie’s loins stirred.  Was he serious?
“I, uh…”
“Joke! Joke!  Spankings don’t come ’til the second date!” His devilish grin made her arousal even worse.  Her cheeks flamed red.
“You are too easy!”  He said.  “So how about it?  Would you like to go to dinner tomorrow?”
Still at a loss for words, she nodded.  
“Great.  Let’s get you back inside and get a new coffee, shall we?”  

--------

The setting sun’s orange glow filtered through Gracie’s blinds and landed on her dinner.  The chicken glowed with an unearthly fervor and Gracie looked away, reviewing what had happened that day.  The car. Michael. Her coffee. The car! Her upcoming date.
Why did he throw her off guard? He was so attractive.  Way out of her league.  She wasn’t sure what had brought him to work in Brookfield, but it wasn’t exactly a mecca for developing professionals and high class lawyers.  He seemed better than the Cafe Escape.  Maybe he was a relative or needed a new start.
She had made herself into a bumbling fool over and over again!  How did he think that she was attractive enough to ask out? Was this just James arranging blind dates for her again?  He had tried that last year with disastrous results.  
The chicken was chewy. It burned her mouth and the faintest taste of freezer burn lingered long after she had swallowed.  She choked it down and set her plate aside.  Just thinking about her date tomorrow made her queasy.   Was she ready to date again?
Her phone vibrated against the side table, jarring her from her anxious thoughts.  “Mom” flashed across the screen and she sighed, picking it up and sliding her finger across the edge.
“Hey mom.”
“Hey sweetie.” Her mom’s voice was distorted by a radio in the background.
“You driving somewhere?” Gracie asked.  She stood, phone to one ear and plate in her other hand.
“Yeah.  Your dad and I are on our way to dinner.”
“That’s cool.  I just finished mine.”  The chicken was only half eaten, but she knew that she couldn’t swallow any more if she tried.
“Where’d you go?” Her mom asked, and Gracie laughed.
“My freezer.”
“Gracie.” Her mom admonished.  “It’s a Friday night. You really do need to get out more.”
“Actually, I am.  Tomorrow!”  Gracie regretted the words instantly.
“Oh?” Her mom asked, prompting her to explain.  She could either lie and say she was going out with friends — she had none — or she could fess up about the dashing cook. 
“The new cook at my regular coffee place asked me out today.”
“Gracie, a cook?” Now her mother’s tone was even worse.
“Yes, mom.  He’s gorgeous.  I locked my keys in my car and he —” Her mom’s laugh cut her short.
“The old damsel-in-distress routine?  I thought you were above that, baby.”
“No, mom.  I seriously locked my keys in my car. Jesus.  I’m not desperate.”
“Okay, so you were just being a ditz. Aaand?”
“I… he helped me unlock my door then asked me out.”
“Well, sweetie.  That’s great.  Where are you going?”
“I don’t know.  He said he would pick me up tomorrow.”
“Oh. You must be really into him.  You’ve never let a guy pick you up on the first date.  I swear, you barely let them pay for dinner.”
“Mom.” Gracie’s voice was higher than she wanted it to be, a complaint in hiding.  “I’m trying not to be so…” She searched for the words.  
“Stubborn?” Her mother suggested.  Her dad’s voice was in the background, asking something.  A few noncommittal noises later, her mom spoke again.  “Dad says to be careful. And to bring your pepper spray.”
“Tell him I will.”  Gracie’s eyes rolled.  Her dad was always on about safety.  No one was good enough for his little princess.  
“He says you need to carry it on your keys.” 
“Mom. He saw me put the pepper spray on my keychain at Christmas.  It hasn’t moved.”
“I know.  He just worries.  We’re at Carmello’s, so I’m going to let you go.  Call me after your date, baby.”
“I’ll try mom.  Have fun.”
“Love you!”
“Love you too.”
Gracie hung up the phone and deposited her dish in the sink.  She had been pacing in the kitchen, plate in hand, for the entire conversation.  There it was.  She couldn’t back out now.  Her mom was expecting her report.  Why had she opened her mouth?
