# Old Chapter: Prologue

“Jay was a valued Guardian.  We’re not disagreeing with you, Michael.  We’re just saying that... he’s gone. No one knows where, or how.  He’s gone rogue.” The bald black man stood silhouetted by the flood lights.  
“Uncle Jay would never...”
“No one ever thinks that their own family, their own blood, would go rogue.  It’s just not them, they say!  But Michael, you know as well as I do that he didn’t send out any distress calls.  His money is gone.  His clothing!  The only thing left in that house is furniture.  His talismans are gone.  Jay even took his photo albums.  Would he have done that if it was some sort of sorcery?"
"What if it was blackmail, Regis?  You can't deny that we get people who try --"
"Yes, Michael, and we have protocols for that. Report to the council immediately.  Plus, what could some blackmailer possibly have against Jay? We long eliminated many of the archaic rules.  We can love.  It makes no sense, Michael.  The only possibility -- the one that we have to rely on -- is that Jay has gone rogue.  The responsibility must've been too much."
"Wouldn't someone have noticed a freaking tiger on the loose in Brookfield?" Michael burst out angrily.  "No one can change their form."
"Maybe he went rogue as a human. Who knows?  Some do.  If by chance we find him, he will stand trial like all of the others.  It's final, Michael. The council has spoken."  Regis closed the book on the nearby podium.  "Now, who will take his place in Brookfield?"
"I will." Michael spoke again without pause.  The council members looked around furtively.  No one had every been allowed to take a rogue's position if they shared blood.  "What? You say he's rogue. Let me prove you wrong."
"Michael... the rules are that..."
"I know the rules." He protested. "And no where in the rules is there a prohibition against family taking over lost guardians' posts."  He took a breath to steady himself.  "Nor is there a prohibition against family taking over a rogue's post.  That's tradition, and I call bullshit.  Give me his post.  Who wants Brookfield anyway?"
"We will have to discuss this, Michael." Regis said curtly.  "Please leave and allow the council to convene."
Michael nodded and turned on his heel to leave.  The other members of the council parted like a wave for Michael and he reached the wooden door with ease.  Shutting it softly behind him, Michael leaned his body against the cool concrete of the bunker wall.
"Shit." He said quietly, rubbing tears away from his eyes.  He knew Jay hadn't gone rogue.  He had talked to the man not two weeks ago and he had sounded fine.  Excited for the holidays, even.  There was something wrong in Brookfield, and Michael was going to figure out exactly what it was.  
He looked up at the beige painted concrete wall just an arm's length away. If he shifted now, would he get trapped in the bunker? Would he be able to move?
The door opened next to him. Hot and sticky air flowed from the chamber as Michael looked up to see his friend, Janene, smile down at him.
"You can come back in now."
"Thanks Janene." He took her offered hand and stepped back into the room.  The council was silently staring at him and he felt his face threaten a blush. He pushed it away.  "Your decision?"  He asked.
"We will allow you to become the new guardian at Brookfield.  You may investigate your uncle's disappearance, but you must keep us informed of any and all news through a nightly update.  Janene has volunteered to be your keeper."  Regis gestured at the tall, gangly red head who had let Michael back in.  
"She will be in Brookfield?"
"No..." Regis paused.  "We believe in you and your intentions.  You may communicate each night instead. That will allow Janene to stay with the mobile unit. We need her.  We need you, too.  If you want to relinquish --"
"I don't."  Michael said.  "I want justice for my uncle.  He deserves better than to be called a traitor. I only hope that if it was me on the other side of this -- me, the one missing, that you --" Michael stared down members of the council, "Would not immediately write me off as a traitor and rogue.  I serve, as we all do, for life.  For the preservation of life.  We are the guardians."  He intoned, and several members joined him.  "We are the barrier between night and day, good and evil. We are the protectors of this earthly world.  We live and die by our posts. Ha!" Everyone, including Regis, joined in the final battle cry.  
"Are there any other issues that have arisen, council?" Regis asked after the commotion quieted.  None spoke.  "This meeting is dismissed.  I will see you all on the next new moon."

"One month." Michael spoke alone in his truck, night squealing in through the crack in his window.  "It's been one month since you've been gone, uncle Jay. But I have not forgotten."  The other words stuck in his throat - the dutiful words of a guardian to a rogue.  Instead, he spoke as a nephew to his uncle.  "If it is within my power, uncle. I will save you from whatever evil you are facing.  This I swear to you."
The truck started with a rumble. It was a long drive to Brookfield, and Michael was already behind schedule.
"Hey!" A voice called from in front of the truck.  "Wait!"
Janene grew from the shadows.  "Don't mess this up, Michael."  She peered through the cracked window.  "Don't mess me up, okay?"  
"I won't.  You know me.  I'll call you when I get there, okay?"
"Okay.  I'll call to have everything turned back on there."  She snaked a hand through the crack.  "I'll see you soon."
"Whenever the moon rises, Janene.  You know it."  Michael grasped her fingers and kissed them lightly.  
"See you on the other side."  He released her fingers and threw the truck in reverse.  It was a long drive.
