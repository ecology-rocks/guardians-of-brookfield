# Snow Demon

"Janene." Michael said tersely.  "I had a public demon encounter tonight."  He heard her sharp intake of breath across the line.
"How public?" She asked him.  He heard a clatter. Presumably it was her reaching for a pen to write down every detail that he shared.
"I took this girl out to a restaurant..."
"Wait, what?" Janene stopped him.  "A girl?"
"Woman, really.  My cover job --"
"As a cook, yes." Janene was silent and allowed him to continue.
"I met her the other day. Asked her out."
"You're dating now?" Janene sounded confused.
"I figured I would give it a try.  After Melody found a husband..."
"I just... wow."  Janene's awkward silence was the impetus for Michael to continue his story.
"Anyway. So we were out at this asian place here.  Uncle Jay brought me once." His voice caught in his throat for a second.  "And we had literally just sat down and they had poured water when an imp materialized in front of the hostess."
"Oh god, one of those?"
"Yeah.  Full throttle, too. After the panic had subsided somewhat, he began to shout about world domination.  Janene, I've never seen anything like it."
"What did you do, Michael?" She asked, her voice deadly serious. 
"Exactly what we're supposed to do.  I transformed and eliminated the problem.  But..."  He was unsure of how to phrase his next observation. "It was so weird.  She watched.  And I mean... she really watched.  She wasn't in the shifter stupor of everyone else.  She was perfectly conscious and aware.  I've never seen any mortal do that."
"Are you sure?"
"She has recollections."
"What did you... how did you?"
"I grabbed her and the body and we hightailed it back to the truck.  I disposed of the body, gave her our bare bones description and brought her home."
"She didn't fight you on it?"
"No.  I think she was in shock."  He admitted.  "But I managed to convince her that her home was safer than mine."
"Well obviously.  Maybe..." Janene took a deep breath.  "Maybe you're right about your uncle.  If there are public demon sightings going on, Brookfield may be a hot zone. Maybe your uncle got caught unawares and..."
"I don't know if death is better or worse than going rogue.  Let's not..." Michael fought back tears.  "Let's not jump to conclusions before we have all the facts."
"So where am I sending the clean up crew to, Michael?" Janene asked, abruptly changing subjects.  "And what about this girl?"
"Clean up goes to Thai Fusion in downtown.  As for the girl... I don't think she's a threat.  I don't know what she is yet, and I doubt she knows.  I'll keep an eye on her."
"Don't go falling in love with a half-demon, Michael."  Janene warned, and Michael laughed.  "She doesn't have horns."
"Really?  Have you looked everywhere?"  Janene's dry tone made him smile.  
"No.  What are you, jealous?"  Michael responded airily.  
"Oh, Michael.  That ship has long since sailed and we both know it."
"The door is always open..."
"Yeah yeah.  Don't you have some bones to bury?"
"I suppose." Michael said.  "Will you report to the council?"
"That is my job."  Janene pointed out.  "I'll speak to you tomorrow.  Stay safe."
"You too."

Dawn came far too early, peeking through the cracks in the blinds and bleeding onto Michael's face.  He must've spent hours awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering what sort of person Gracie was.  The last number he had seen was 4:07, shining bright into his eyes before they grew too heavy to keep open.  
The Cafe Escape was already bustling when Michael arrived.  His shift officially started at 8am, but many patrons stopped for their morning coffee before the kitchen was open.
"Late night?" James asked smiling as Michael emerged from the swinging double doors to the kitchen.
"Something like that." He smiled.  Michael prayed that Gracie would have the foresight to realize that if she shared the shifter thing with anyone, they would declare her mentally insane.  
"With Gracie?"  James asked, raising his eyebrows.  Michael tied the apron strings around his neck and smiled.
"We had a great date." He lied.  "But I dropped her off at home and got caught up in working on something for a while."
"Well, that's good." James acquiesced.  He almost looked relieved, and Michael wondered just how much James cared about this woman.
"Yeah." Michael agreed.  "Any food orders yet?"
"As always.  Tickets are on the back counter." James waved his free hand towards the back counter, balancing a full cup of coffee with the other.  "Order up for Matthew!"  He shouted at the people standing near the tables.  One came forward to retrieve his cup.
"Thanks James."
"No problem.  See you tomorrow."  James turned to the next handwritten ticket.  
Michael's phone buzzed as he walked through the relative safety of the kitchen's doors.  It was from Gracie.
"Are you at work?" She asked.  Of course she would want to talk.  He was sure that she had more questions.  He had questions for her, too.  Like how the fuck she had stayed conscious through the demon fight.
"Yes." He responded.  "I'll have a break at noon if you want to meet me."  He sent the message and immediately regretted it.  Butterflies turned into wasps buzzing angrily in his stomach.  But he knew that, for better or for worse, he and Gracie were tied together by something stronger than lust.

"Order up!" Michael called cheerily through the door.  "Ham and swiss on rye!"  He set the plate on the counter and pulled his glove off to wipe sweat from his brow. 
The clock shone green numbers at him, 11:59.  He reached behind, untying the apron strings, and lifted the neck closure over his head.  
"My break." He called to Carlos, who looked up and nodded in agreement.  "I'll be back at 1."
Michael ducked through the swinging doors and into the lobby area.  James had been replaced by Carlie, who was busy taking orders from a long line.  Michael ducked under the counter and made his way to the front door, intending to search for Gracie's car, when he heard her voice behind him.
"Michael!" She called, and he turned. She was seated at a table in the corner along the front wall.  
"Hey, Gracie." He closed the distance, surveying the table. "Do you want anything to eat?"
"No, it's fine.  I thought maybe we would go somewhere else? Do you have time?"
"Sure." He said, offering a hand to her.  She accepted and rose, grabbing her coat with her free hand.  "Are you hungry? Or do you just have more questions?"
"Mostly just the questions." She admitted.  Michael held the front door open and waited for her to leave.  
"Well, what sort of questions do you have?" He asked as the door shut behind them.  
"I... You don't mind, right?" She asked tentatively, and he laughed.
"It's unusual, yes, but I don't mind talking about it. I'm not breaking any rules."
"Okay. Well. Why do you have a job?"  She asked.  "Don't you have more important things to be doing than cooking food?"
“I have bills just like you.”
“They don’t pay you to be a…”
“Guardian.” He finished for her.  “And yes, they give us a living stipend.  But this is historically a low-activity area.  My uncle had a job for years. That's actually how we found out that he was missing."
"I thought you said he was dead."  Gracie furrowed her eyebrows and he shrugged.
"He's missing, presumed dead.  After the demon encounter last night, I have no idea what to think.  Some other guardians think that he's gone rogue.  I don't think that he's capable of going rogue.  I came here -- to Brookfield -- because I thought that he might be in trouble."
"So the demon last night was unexpected?" Gracie asked, and he nodded.
"I would never have purposely put you in danger, Gracie. I barely know you.  As it is, I've probably screwed up any chance I had of getting to know you better."
"What makes you say that?"  She asked, and he shrugged.
"Now you know all of my secrets.  I certainly wouldn't date me. Or any other guardian for that matter. It's too dangerous."
"I don't mind." She said.  "As far as I see it, you still owe me a first date.  I didn't even eat last night."
"Not after I dropped you off?" He asked, and she shook her head.
"I was too freaked out. I woke up this morning though, and I was ravenous."
"Well, what time do you get off of work tonight?" He asked her.  "I would love to take you on a proper date."
"Eleven." She said. "I work three to eleven."
"Okay, well. How about I pick you up then?"
"Why don't we meet somewhere instead?" She asked.  "I know that Jack's is open until 2 or 3. It's a bar, but it should work."
"That sounds fine with me." He said.  He reached for her car door and opened it.  "I'll see you then."

A flash of light caught Michael's eye on his way back into the Cafe Escape.  He turned.  The snow mound in the corner of the parking lot was growing.  The tattered white and brown mess was bulging unnaturally, and Michael's demon sense flared.  
"Fuck." He said, annoyed and perturbed by the new situation.  A second demon attack in twenty four hours?  In public?  He moved quickly away from the Cafe Escape window and towards the growing snow pile.  It now had arms and a gruesome, bloodied head.  The oozing brown-red goo came from the demon's nose and eyes.  Michael's hand shook as he pulled his work shirt over his head.  He hung it on the red spiral wheel extruding from the brick wall, and reached for his pants.  
"How the fuck am I supposed to dispose of something made of snow?" He asked himself.  The pants slipped down and he began to change.
Bear-Michael leapt at the snow monster, landing easily on it's arm.  He expected the arm to snap, but soon discovered that the true demon flesh lay underneath.  It was a goliath.  He gripped with his claws but was thrown off of the muscled arm with sickening ease. He landed hard against the brick wall, and said a silent prayer that the noise outside was not attracting attention inside.  
The goliath rose to its full height.  Snow and mush dripped from its arms and legs. Its face was still oozing blood gunk, but bear-Michael paid it no mind.  He righted himself and began stalking towards the demon.  It towered well over the building now, and seemed to keep growing, inches in seconds.  
The bear roared and leapt, landing short of the demon's body and instead sliding under it into what remained of the snow bank. Roaring, the demon tried to turn, but the snow hindered its path and bear-Michael had time to recover and leap again, this time making contact with its back.
The bear did what bears do best: it climbed.  The snow may have been the demon's body armor, but it also served as an excellent climbing post.  The demon was squirming now, wriggling and trying to bat the bear away as if it was no more than a fly.  Bear-Michael, however, was faster, and easily scaled the snow-monster, perching himself on the goliath's shoulders for the briefest second.  Bear-Michael began tearing into the snow, narrowly avoiding icy pinwheeling arms.  He dug for gold, and soon found it.
The flesh was gray, as if it had been rotting for weeks.  It was cool and peeled away like mush, revealing the juicy blood filled core.  Michael bit, and the demon screamed. 
The demon thundered to its knees as bear-Michael continued to drink. A demon's blood was its life.  The screams died down, and the struggles turned to seizures.
Pausing his meal, bear-Michael hopped down from the snow-demon mound and changed briefly back to human form.  He stood naked before the bleeding head.  Its eyes were open and unblinking, but Michael knew it had not yet perished.
"Demon." He said quietly.  "What did you do with the last guardian?"  He kicked it in the snow-nose, not caring if it was effective.  The demon moaned.
"We did to the last guardian what we will do to the girl."  Its voice came quiet and clear through the snow.  "She will die.  You will die.  I am but a messenger."  The wheezes had turned to gurgles and Michael knew that he must finish his chore.  He walked back to his pants, thrown carelessly on the wet ground next to his shirt.  He rummaged through and found his cell, dialing Janene.
"Clean up needed." He announced as soon as she picked up the phone.  He could feel the demon's life force waning.  "This one is in snow.  Cafe Escape.  Too big for me to deal with alone."  He ignored her cries of protest and clicked the phone off.  He knew that she would be there.  In minutes, most likely.  The clean up crew from the night before couldn't have gotten far.  
Michael shifted back to bear, climbing on top of the demon with ease.  He lowered his face and resumed feeding.
