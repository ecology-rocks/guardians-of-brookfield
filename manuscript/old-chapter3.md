# First Date

“Stay there.” Michael commanded as he removed the keys from the ignition.  He opened his door and climbed out before she could protest.  Her eyes trailed him as walked around the headlights and towards her door.  Her mom had been right: he loved tradition.
Gracie’s fingers gripped her purse tight, tighter when the door swung open and whooshed the chilly night air into the cab.
“My lady.” Michael offered both of his hands, and Gracie tore one hand away from its death grip on the purse strap to take his.  
“Thank you.” She said as he half-helped, half-lifted her down to the parking garage’s concrete.  She landed somewhat nimbly, but Michael did not release his grip.
“Thank you.” He echoed her, gazing appreciatively down at her.  “For coming.  I hope you like asian.”
Gracie nodded.  Michael pulled her gently away from the door and shut it.  Releasing her hands, he gestured towards the ramp.  
“Shall we?”
Boisterous laughs assaulted her ears as they entered the Velvet Dragon, an establishment whose decor held true to its name. Huge, deep red tapestries lined the walls and framed the hostess station, complementing the mahogany wood podium.  An asian woman looked up at them over her wire-rimmed glasses, gray hair piled into a tight bun.
“Two tonight?” Her voice was clear, despite the din of the restaurant behind her.
“Yes, reservation under Ridge.” Michael’s deep voice answered.  
“Ah, yes.  Welcome, Michael.  Right this way.”  The lady smiled warmly, a sharp departure from her previous stiff and unwieldy appearance.  
She stepped down from the podium and wound her way around the tapestry and beyond to the dining room.  Gracie followed, with Michael right behind her.  She could feel warmth emanating from him.  Or, perhaps that was just her desire.
“This place is amazing.”  He said inches from her ear.  His scruff brushed gently against her neck, sending shivers down her spire.  “I know you’re going to love it.”
“I’m sure I will.” Gracie agreed, trying her best to not melt into a slew of gelatinous lust.  
Michael took the menus from the hostess and fluidly pulled out a chair for Gracie.  She shifted her skirt under her legs and sat on the velvet cushioned chair.  Michael took the seat across from her.   
“So tell me about yourself, Gracie.” Michael wasted no time.  Gracie looked up from the menu and smiled.
“I was born and raised here.  I work B shift as an x-ray tech at Brookfield Memorial. I love animals but don’t currently have any. Um… what else do you want to know?”
“Why’d you say yes to me?” He leaned forward over his menu.
“Free food?” She offered. He looked momentarily perplexed.  “You are paying, aren’t you?”  She grinned.
“Not anymore.” He answered wryly.  “But seriously.  Why?”
“Why not?  I’m single.  You seem like a good guy.  James likes you, so…”
He nodded thoughtfully.  
“CanI get you two something to drink?” The voice startled them both.  Michael jumped back, Gracie looked up.
“Water, please?”  Gracie broke the silence.  
“Me too.” Michael agreed with her.  
“Any appetizers?” The waitress asked, a fake smile plastered on her face.
“Spring rolls, please.” Michael answered before Gracie could decline.  The waitress left.
“What about you?  Why did you ask me out?” Gracie asked Michael and he seemed to blush, although it was hard to tell in the dim light of the restaurant.  
“You intrigue me.” He answered.  “I’ve never met anyone quite like you.  Plus, I figured you owed me. After I saved you and all.”
“And how did you get to the Cafe Escape?” She asked another question before he could counter with one of his own.
“I… It’s a long story.” He answered.  A moment went by before he spoke again.  “My uncle lived here.  He left his house to me when he passed away last month.  I didn’t really have any ties in Baltimore, so I decided that a fresh start somewhere else was exactly what I needed.”
“And you chose Brookfield, of all places.  Why not just sell the house and move someplace… else?”
“I thought that a small town was exactly what I needed.” He reached across the table to capture her hands, clasped together on the table in front of her. “I hope this isn’t off-putting, but I am really, really attracted to you.”
His touch sent tingles through her entire body.  She smiled nervously at his admission, though not because she was put off.  Rather, she was nervous that she — not him — would be the off-putting one.  
“Sorry.” He withdrew his hand.  “I didn’t mean to be that guy.”
“No, no.  You’re fine.” She insisted.  Her hand felt cold and dead, now bereft of his touch.  “I’m really attracted to you, too.”
Michael’s eyes grew wide as a clatter sounded behind Gracie.  
“Out!  Out!”  The elderly hostess was shouting angrily.  Gracie turned in her chair to watch.  It took a second for her eyes to adjust.  
There was a… thick wall of fire behind a naked midget.  A naked, angry, screaming midget. The midget — Gracie presumed it was male — was jumping around, waving his arms in the air, trying his best to either do jumping jacks or draw attention.  
Michael leapt from his chair and grabbed Gracie’s arm.  “Get back.” He ordered, and she moved with him around the table.  The midget seemed to be getting angrier.  The fire, brighter and hotter.  “Come on, under the table.” He insisted, kicking his chair out of the way.  
Chaos streamed around them as patrons moved to the back, trying to find an exit.  Gracie crawled under the table, a surreal reality surrounding her.  In a sense of panic-caused clarity, she briefly wondered if he could see up her skirt.  She pushed the thought aside and finished her crawl under the table.  Seconds later, he joined her, glass of water in hand.  
“Wet your shirt, just in case.”  He poured water on his button down and handed the glass to her.  She poured a bit on her hand and rubbed it on the collar of her top.  The moisture soon soaked through to her collarbone, but she fought away the chill.  The elder hostess was still shouting “Out!  Out with you, demon!”  
Gracie peered out from underneath the tablecloth.  Somewhere in their migration to relative safety, the midget had created an entire circle of fire around himself, and had now obscured all but his face.  
He had stopped screaming, though.  The old woman had been backed up by the flames, as had everyone else, but the midget — the imp? — had gone silent.  Gracie noticed that the room was not smoky at all, and it seemed that she had wet her shirt for nothing.
“The flames…” She hissed at Michael.  “They’re not real.  No smoke.  No spread.”
Michael nodded in agreement.  A booming voice interrupted any verbal response he was about to give.
“RESIDENTS OF EARTH! PREPARE TO SUBMIT! I AM YOUR OVERLORD!”  The midget-imp had a surprisingly deep voice, in stark contrast to the high pitched shrills it had been emitting earlier.  “ACCEPT MY RULE OR ACCEPT YOUR PUNISHMENT!” 
“Shit. I was afraid this would happen.”  Michael’s voice rang hard and true in her ear.  She looked over at him, surprised to find him bare chested. “Stay here.”
Michael scooted forward through the table cloth in a surprisingly fluid movement. Gracie watched in surprise as he ripped his pants off in an epic Superman imitation, and suddenly began to warp.  There was no other way to describe it.  He melted down to all fours and began to sprout dark brown hair all over. His nose elongated, his fingernails grew.  And suddenly, Michael was a bear. A bear that was much, much larger than the naked Michael had been not seconds earlier.  
“Michael!” She cried, but the bear either could not hear her or didn’t recognize his own name.  If that was still Michael.  She crawled from beneath the table and quickly scanned the room.  The restaurant was quiet now.  The distraught elderly hostess had taken one look at the man-bear and had fallen dumbstruck and silent.  Most of the patrons had found an exit; those who hadn’t were huddled in the back corner, smart phones in hand.  
Bear-Michael let out a deep, earthy growl.  The imp paid him no mind, but continued imposing his demands upon the listening ears.  
“YOU WILL BOW TO ME!” The imp shouted. Bear-Michael stalked ever closer to the ring of fire.  
“YOU WILL LOVE ME!” The imp careened, staring at the hostess whose eyes were fixated on the large ursine monster.  
“YOU WILL SERVE ME!” On the third proclamation, Bear-Michael leapt through the ring of fire and pounced triumphantly on the imp.  The fire disappeared instantly, and Gracie saw that the bear had landed with both front paws, claws extended, on the imp’s throat and jaw.  The legs kicked futilely and the imp gurgled.  Two more jerking kicks, and the imp stilled.
