# The Search

The parking lot's cracked pavement and skyscraper lights overwhelmed Gracie's senses.  For a second, she was unsure if she was dreaming again.  She felt a warm hand on her shoulder?

"Is this the one?"  Michael's quiet voice pulled her back into reality.  Stomach in knots, she nodded. 

He pulled closer to the rusted metal building and put the SUV into park.  The engine stuttered to a halt.

"Are you ready?"  He asked her.  "Is this the building?"

"I don't..."  Gracie trailed off.  "In my dream, I was inside when I saw him.  Then I was just... outside.  This is definitely the outside place. I don't know about the inside part."

"Okay."  He agreed.  He pulled his seatbelt off.  "You got the phone?"

"Yeah." She held it up so that he could see.  "I feel like a ninja."  She took her seatbelt off.

"You look it, too."  Michael smiled at her.  He looked equally ridiculous, dressed in spandex from head to toe.  

"At least we won't ruin clothes if something happens."  She said.  She got out of the car and shut the door behind her.  Michael followed.

"We can check this one first."  She said.  It was clear that he was letting her lead.  After all, it was  her dream. Her sense of deja vu.  Her uncle.

She strode with confidence that she did not feel towards the garage-like, banded metal door.  It had an icy metal handle near the ground, and she reached for it.

"Wait."  Michael said, and she retracted her hand.  "I bet there's a side door, somewhere.  Maybe a key."

"We're already breaking and entering."  She stood back up and followed him to the corner of the building.

"Still. Normal door.  Less noise."  

She could see the outline of his butt flexing with every step.  She smiled, briefly remembering the night before.
